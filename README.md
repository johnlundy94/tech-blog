# Tech Blog

## Description

This project helps any techie out there that wants to share their experience, comments or concerns for any tech.
If there is any tech user out there who is looking to share or discover anything about any tech. This would be the place for them to go.
I learned through developing this app how to use express middleware to connect the back-end to the front-end. Handlebars.js was used for the View in this MVC format. Lastly, I learned how to use authentication to ensure that each user needs to be logged in, in order to use the site.
